##Set up
To set up the project, first open the flask server in flask_query_server
```
cd flask_query_server
```

then run the server: 
```
python flask_run.py
```
While keeping the server running, open another terminal window to run the user interface of the visualization
(make sure you have the http-server downloaded): 
```
http-server [path] [options]
```

[path] defaults to ./public if the folder exists, and ./ otherwise.
