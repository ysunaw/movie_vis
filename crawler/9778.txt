Ice Cube also featured in the Barbershop, Ride Along, and XXX film series, while also serving as a producer to several  films, including Straight Outta Compton (2015), a biographical film depicting the career of N.W.A.As a businessman, Ice Cube has founded his clothing line, Solo by Cube, as well as the 3 on 3 basketball league BIG3, which predominately features retired NBA players.
