Coburn provided the voice of Henry Waternoose in the Pixar film Monsters, Inc.During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Coburn cultivated an image synonymous with "cool"  and, along with such contemporaries as Lee Marvin, Steve McQueen, and Charles Bronson, became one of the prominent "tough-guy" actors of his day.
