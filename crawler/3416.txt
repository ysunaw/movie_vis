Charles Harmon, Sr. (father) Virginia King (m)Demi Gene Guynes[n 1] (born November 11, 1962), professionally known as Demi Moore (/dmi/ d-MEE), is an American actress, former songwriter, and model. Moore dropped out of high school at age 16 to pursue an acting career and appeared in the men's magazine Oui in 1981. After making her film debut later that year, she appeared on the soap opera General Hospital and subsequently gained recognition for her work in Blame It on Rio (1984) and St. Elmo's Fire (1985). Her first film to become both a critical and commercial hit was About Last Night... (1986), which established her as a Hollywood star.In 1990, Moore starred in Ghost the highest-grossing film of that year, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. She had a string of additional box-office successes in the early 1990s, including A Few Good Men (1992), Indecent Proposal (1993), and Disclosure (1994). In 1996, Moore became the highest-paid actress in film history when she was paid a then-unprecedented fee of $12.5 million to star in Striptease, a film that was a high-profile disappointment. Her next major role, G.I. Jane (1997), for which she famously shaved her head, was followed by a lengthy break and downturn in Moore's career. In the 2000s, she secured supporting roles in films like Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003) and Bobby (2006). Outside of acting, Moore famously posed nude on two Vanity Fair covers, and has had high profile marriages to actors Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher.
