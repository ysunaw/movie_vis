Louis Germain David de Fun¨¨s de Galarza (French pronunciation:[lwi d fy.ns]; 31 July 1914 ¨C 27 January 1983) was a popular French actor and one of the giants of French comedy alongside Bourvil and Fernandel. His acting style is remembered for its high energy performance, wide range of facial expressions and exclamations, and exaggerated impatience, haughtiness and selfishness. A considerable part of his best known acting was directed by Jean Girault, and with whom he wrote and directed the French classic L'Avare (1980), in which de Fun¨¨s also starred.He was (and often still is) a household name in several European countries (Greece, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Poland, Bulgaria, GDR Germany, Spain, Turkey, Albania, Romania, USSR, Iran and Yugoslavia in particular) for many years, yet remained almost unknown in the Anglosphere. He was exposed to a wider audience only once in the United States, in 1974, with the release of The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob, which was nominated for a Golden Globe. According to a 1968 poll, he was France's favourite actor ¨C having played over 130 roles in film and over 100 on stage.
